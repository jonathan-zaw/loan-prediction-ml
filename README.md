# loan-prediction-ml

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict loan approval status. By leveraging a dataset containing crucial information about loan applicants, we aim to build a robust system that can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions. This can lead to streamlined processes, reduced risk, and improved efficiency in loan approvals.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises **614 entries** and **13 columns**, encompassing a mix of categorical and numerical features. These features provide insights into an applicant's financial standing, employment details, and property information, all of which are relevant to loan approval decisions. The **target variable**, `Loan_Status`, clearly indicates whether a loan was approved (`Y`) or rejected (`N`).

**Key Features :**

* **Demographics:** `Gender`, `Married`, `Dependents`
* **Education & Employment:** `Education`, `Self_Employed`
* **Income Details:** `ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`
* **Loan Specifics:** `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`
* **Credit History:** `Credit_History`
* **Property Information:** `Property_Area`
* **Approval Status (Target):** `Loan_Status`

Project Workflow

This project followed a structured approach to build and evaluate the loan prediction model:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handled missing values strategically by imputing categorical data with the mode.
    * Removed the `Loan_ID` column as it was deemed irrelevant for modeling.
    * Converted categorical features into numerical representations using label encoding for better model interpretability.
    * Scaled numerical features (`ApplicantIncome`, `CoapplicantIncome`, `LoanAmount`, `Loan_Amount_Term`) using `StandardScaler` to ensure consistent feature scaling.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visualized the distribution of the `Loan_Status` variable using informative seaborn count plots to understand class balance.
    * Investigated the correlation between various features and the loan approval status to identify potential predictors.
    * Assessed the class imbalance present in the dataset, which can impact model performance.

3.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    * Defined the feature matrix `X` and the target variable `y`.
    * Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate model generalization.
    * Implemented **K-Fold Cross-Validation** (with a suitable number of folds) to obtain a more robust estimate of model performance on unseen data.
    * Experimented with a range of established machine learning algorithms:
        * **Logistic Regression**
        * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
        * **Decision Tree Classifier**
        * **Random Forest Classifier**
        * **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
    * Evaluated the performance of each model using the **accuracy score** and **cross-validation scores**.

4.  **âš™Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    * Utilized **RandomizedSearchCV** to efficiently search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the **Logistic Regression** model, aiming to maximize its performance.

Results

The project involved a thorough evaluation of multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective algorithm for predicting loan approval. The selection of the best model was based on a combination of factors, including:

* **Accuracy on the test set.**
* **Consistency and robustness of performance as indicated by cross-validation scores.**


Technologies Used

This project was built using the following key technologies and libraries:

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
